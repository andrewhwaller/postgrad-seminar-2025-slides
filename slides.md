# Luke 13:31--35
At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, “Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.”
He said to them, “Go and tell that fox (τῇ ἀλώπεκι ταύτῃ) for me, ‘Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work.
Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.’
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!
How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!
See, your house is left to you.
And I tell you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’”

# *An. Apoc.* 89:42
\[T\]he dogs began devouring the flock.
Also, the *foxes* and the wild boars began devouring them, until the Lord of the flock raised up a certain ram from among the sheep, to lead them.

# *An. Apoc.* 89:49
\[A\]ll of those dogs, foxes, and wild boars feared it and fled from \[the ram\].

# *An. Apoc.* 89:49--50
\[That ram\] became ruler and leader of the flock.
Then that house grew large and spacious, indeed it was built for that flock.
A great and lofty tower was erected upon that house for the Lord of the flock.
And that house was lower, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the flock stood upon that tower, and they spread before him a full table.

# *An. Apoc.* 89:55--56
And \[the Lord of the flock\] abandoned them into the hands of the lions, leopards, wolves, and hyenas, and into the hands of the foxes, and to all the beasts.
And those wild beasts proceeded to tear the flock to pieces.
I saw too that he abandoned their house and their tower, and he gave all of them into the hands of the lions to tear and devour them—into the hands of all the beasts.

# Nehemiah 4

# Nehemiah 4:3
Tobiah the Ammonite... said, “That stone wall they are building—any fox (<sc>lxx</sc>: ἀλώπηξ) going upon it would break it down!”

# Nehemiah 4:7--15
But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the gaps were beginning to be closed, they were very angry, and all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
So we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night\.\.\.\.
When our enemies heard that their plot was known to us, and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.
